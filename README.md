# NDia_Project 5
The purpose of this program is to determine whether a user-entered 3Ã—3 grid of numbers forms a valid Lo Shu Magic Square. A Lo Shu Magic Square contains the numbers 1 through 9 exactly once, and the sums of each row, column, and diagonal are all equal. This project simulates the square using three parallel one-dimensional arrays (instead of a two-dimensional array) and checks the magic square conditions using modular functions.

The objects of this project:
-Learn to organize code into modular functions that each perform a single task.
-Practice passing parallel one-dimensional arrays as arguments to functions and returning results.
-Implement checks for number range, uniqueness, and equality of row, column, and diagonal sums.
-Use loops and conditional statements to process and validate data.
-Apply array indexing techniques to handle a grid layout without using a two-dimensional array.
-Reinforce the use of constants for maintainability.
-Gain experience with clear program output formatting and user prompts.
